    <div class="container">
      <p> If summer is the season of weddings, then winter is the season of wedding dresses.
        But the halt of all production in China due to the coronavirus, is affecting wedding planning.
        Brides and grooms in the United States are being left without wedding attire.</p>

      <p> Boutiques throughout the U.S. are having to alert bridal parties of a shortage of wedding dresses,
        a delay in delivery of long awaited dresses and are unable to complete rushed orders.</p>

      <p> China extended the Lunar New Year break, to prevent the spreading of the virus.
        For nearly three weeks the facilities have remained closed and China’s citizens have been self quarantined. </p>

      <p> For some the coronavirus already affected their wedding plans.
        Eric Holden’s wedding was in early February, around the time of the Lunar New Year.
        He ordered his suit from Indochino, the men’s custom suit website. </p>

      <p> While ordering the suit he was informed it could be delayed due to the Lunar New Year but was assured he would receive it on time.
        “I started to get worried when the Coronavirus started to make more news so checked back with Indochino
        and was told about 10 days before the wedding it wouldn’t arrive until after the date I needed,”
        Holden said. He ended up having to get a suit from the Men's Warehouse in order to have wedding attire.</p>

      <p> Abigail Crawford, a Phd candidate at the University of got engaged in November but chose to wait after the holiday season to shop for a wedding dress.
        “I specifically went to BHLDN because our engagement was fairly short and they are usually able to ship (in-stock) dresses within 2 weeks,
        compared to normal bridal shops that can take months.” Crawford said.</p>

      <p>BHLDN, Anthropologie’s wedding line has a dress line specifically for “shop last minute Bridal.”
        Crawford ordered her dress on Feb. 15,
        with the scheduled delivery date on March 31 since then the delivery of the dress has been rescheduled twice.
        “I have time but am starting to look at backup plans.
        I’m mostly looking at ones BHLDN still has in stock, but I haven’t chosen one yet,” Crawford said.
        “There are also a few sample sales at local boutiques in the next few months that I’ll probably go to, I’m lucky that I’m a sample size.”</p>

      <p>On Feb. 19, CNBC said as the coronavirus spreads throughout China, small businesses in the United States are suffering because many of their materials come from China. This comes at a time when the small business market has been on the
        upward
        swing and regarded with optimism.
        Fortune magazine reported the bridal industry is primarily made up of 6,000 small businesses that receive silks and lace from China while the dresses are made in the United States, the material are sources in China. They export 80% of the
        United States bridal industry’s wedding dresses and materials.

        “We have heard concerns from our retailers regarding their other vendors having shipment delays from China,” said Carol Hannah owner of New York based boutique, Carol Hannah Bridal. Hannah’s designs and orders will not be affected by the
        virus
        as they produce their materials and fabrics in house.

        According to Hannah, brides should begin to shop for wedding dresses 6-12 months before their wedding date because most designers produce dresses to order rather than carry a stock.

        “It’s more likely that a bride’s dress to order would simply be delayed by the virus rather than a bride unable to get one at all, at this point,” the designer said.

        In an effort to curb the contagion of the virus, the Chinese government extended the the week long break following, Lunar New Year. Forbes magazine reported that 45% of factories reopened with only 20% of their employees. Production factories
        had to apply to reopen and comly to certain standards.

        Paul Sives, chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Southwest China, told Forbes, companies have to provide two masks per employee for the day and must have at least two weeks of masks available for employees in their storage.
        Unfortunately there is such a need for masks and not enough production of them that companies have been unable to meet the standard.

        On Feb. 19, the National Bridal Retailers Association released a statement regarding a possibility of a shortage in dresses and materials.

        “We have been consistently monitoring the situation in China since the reports of the virus began. Fortunately most shipping delays are minimal and anticipated the close of the factories due to the Chinese New Year, and they expected the
        production times were already calculated into most orders placed by bridal retailers.” the National Bridal Retailers Association said.

        The association represents over 1,000 independently owned bridal retailers in the United States that work with each other to provide for their customers.

        In December 2019, the import of international trade deficit was up in anticipation for the Lunar New Year, businesses were importing large amounts of goods for their stock. But imports fell after the signing of ‘Phase 1’ of the China Trade
        Deal
        in January.
